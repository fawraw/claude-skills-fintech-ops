# claude-skills-fintech-ops

A curated set of [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skills extracted from a decade of running FinTech infrastructure, trading platforms, and broker-side systems in production.

Each skill is a single Markdown file with a YAML front-matter that Claude Code (and other agentic environments) can auto-discover. Drop them into your `~/.claude/commands/` (global) or `.claude/commands/` (per project) and Claude will use them whenever the context matches.

## Why this exists

Generic LLM advice on financial markets, network gear, or broker-grade infra is rarely good enough. These skills capture the things that:

- only show up in production (the third WebSocket trap, the third Wednesday rule, the BPIPE-vs-BLPAPI cost cliff)
- are obvious once you've been burned but invisible from any tutorial
- get reused across multiple projects and would be tedious to re-explain to a fresh assistant context

## How to use

### As Claude Code skills (recommended)

Pick the skills you want and copy them to your skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fawraw/claude-skills-fintech-ops.git
cp claude-skills-fintech-ops/trading/financial-dates.md ~/.claude/commands/
cp claude-skills-fintech-ops/network/nginx-websocket.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

Or symlink the whole directory:

```bash
ln -s "$PWD/claude-skills-fintech-ops" ~/.claude/skills-fintech-ops
```

Claude Code (and compatible agents) read the YAML front-matter (`name`, `description`) to decide when a skill is relevant.

### As reference documentation

Every file is also readable on its own. Browse the directories above for production-grade notes on the matching topics.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome, especially if you spot a production caveat that should be flagged in one of the skills.

Skill format:

- Markdown with YAML front-matter (`name`, `description`)
- Self-contained, no cross-skill imports
- "When to use" section near the top, so Claude can match context fast
- Code blocks tagged with their language for highlighting
- No company-specific IPs, hostnames, or credentials
